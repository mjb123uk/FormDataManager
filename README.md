# FormDataManager

This Modx extra is a Custom Manager Page (CMP) that can be used to define layouts for viewing and exporting data created from forms.

The export file will match the defined layout including any required default values irrespective of the form fields saved.

If you change the structure of a form you wil need to remove the existing layout and then define a new form layout.
Note - please ensure you have exported any stored form data with the existing layout before removing and defining a new layout.

This CMP uses the Modx 2.3+ menu system and by default creates a menu entry under the Extras (Components) menu.
